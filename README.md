# Hate-speech-detection-classifier-algorithm-comparasion
This project aims to provide a comparasion of accuracy scores of multiple classifiers in context of sentiment analysis of twitter data. The aim for sentiment analysis is to make internet a safer place by predicting which tweets are racist/sexist or neither and taking action accordingly.

DETAILS OF THE PROJECT:

Sentiment Analysis of twitter data.ipynb file is the complete code file with the preprocessing, testing, training and deployment of all the models of different classifiers that we have used.

train.csv is the dataset for training the models and the trained models are tested on the test.csv file to predict accuracy scores of different classifiers.


Claasifiers implemented:
1. Support Vector Machine(SVM)
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
